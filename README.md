This is a project with an interesting topic: Netflix shows. 

*('Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices')*

The dataset I got here containts the in formation of the shows that aired on Netflix till 25/09/2021 and the target of this project is learning about the situation of the Netflix shows from the past to now by answering a several questions which come to me when I look at this dataset. I hope this project will give you a general view of Netflix shows and you could know more abount this famous video streaming platform.

I aslo use Power BI to show important visualizations on a dashboard to generate what we do in this project, which is the one you saw in the top of this description.

I. Libararies used in this Project:
1. Numpy: working with data in array type.
2. Pandas: working with data in Series and Data Frame type.
3. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly: create data visualizations.
4. WordCloud: create a plot for text data.

II. Dataset: 'netflix_titles.csv'

III. Target: Understand what are the shows on Netflix. Finding out how they have changed throughout the years. We will known who are the main target customers of Netflix and how their entertainment habits like.

IV. Pre-processing the data:

The initial dataset was not ready for analysing so I have to do these cleaning works:

- Finding out the number of missing values.
- Determine which columns are uneccessary, risky and delete them.
- Filling missing values with proper filling-values.
- Change the type of columns which have wrong type.

V. Analysing the Netflix data:

After all the cleaning steps, now the data is ready for processing, now it's time for us to ask the questions about this dataset. Each answer for each question will help us understand more and more about the Netflix shows. So let's begin!
